### Basketball

In my free time, I love playing basketball. I was first introduced to the game in third grade, and from that moment, I fell in love with it. I would shoot hoops every day, whether at school, in my backyard, or at an indoor gym. As I grew older, my passion for basketball only intensified. I started watching countless games to learn from the many talented players. Basketball became my life. I took private lessons and immersed myself in the sport, joining clubs to gain experience and prepare for high school basketball.

My greatest strength has always been my shooting, and it's what I'm known for. In eighth grade, during practice scrimmages, I would often heat up and make a significant impact on offense. Coaches were impressed with my skill level, especially my shooting ability. As I adjusted to the competition and the speed of the game, my skills began to shine in real games. Some games, I would catch fire and keep shooting, while in others, I might have a cold streak for a bit.

My first year of high school basketball was filled with ups and downs. At the beginning of the season, I averaged just 2-3 points per game, but by the end, I was scoring 8-14 points per game. This improvement was a huge leap for me. I continue to work hard and prepare myself for my sophomore year, eager to play on the junior varsity team.
