### Basketball

In my free time, I love playing basketball. I was first introduced to the game in third grade, and from that moment, I fell in love with it. I would shoot hoops every day, whether at school, in my backyard, or at an indoor gym. As I grew older, my passion for basketball only intensified. I started watching countless games to learn from the many talented players. Basketball became my life. I took private lessons and immersed myself in the sport, joining clubs to gain experience and prepare for high school basketball.

My greatest strength has always been my shooting, and it's what I'm known for. In eighth grade, during practice scrimmages, I would often heat up and make a significant impact on offense. Coaches were impressed with my skill level, especially my shooting ability. As I adjusted to the competition and the speed of the game, my skills began to shine in real games. Some games, I would catch fire and keep shooting, while in others, I might have a cold streak for a bit.

My first year of high school basketball was filled with ups and downs. At the beginning of the season, I averaged just 2-3 points per game, but by the end, I was scoring 8-14 points per game. This improvement was a huge leap for me. I continue to work hard and prepare myself for my sophomore year, eager to play on the junior varsity team.

### Music
Another passion of mine is music. I was introduced to it at a young age and have enjoyed exploring various aspects of it ever since. My musical journey began with the guitar, where I took private lessons and found immense joy in playing. I performed at concerts and continually honed my skills.

As I grew older, I was introduced to the violin at school, as it was the closest string instrument available since there was no guitar option. I learned the basics and played the violin from elementary school through middle school. In middle school, I also took up the double bass, which is not commonly played. The conductor needed someone to play the bass guitar, and I stepped up to the challenge.

Another instrument I played was the piano. I enjoyed playing my favorite songs, including many Hindi songs. During prayer sessions, I would set the tone by playing appropriate music. However, the most consistent element of my musical journey has been classical singing. I have always loved singing and would often sing in the bathroom. Recognizing my talent, my parents enrolled me in classes where I learned different classical notes and techniques. As I matured, I performed in concerts and trained my voice.

I continue to sing in high school and am preparing for another concert this summer. Additionally, I am part of the school band, where I play the bass guitar, an instrument I have not given up. I am excited to see how my musical talents will develop throughout high school.
